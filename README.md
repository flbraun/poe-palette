# PoE Palette
Screen workers love command palettes to quickly access actions in their frequently used programs. Since Path of Exile is basically a second job and the comunity offers a lot of external resources and tools, it's about time it got its own palette!

## Capabilities
- Search for items in the [community wiki](https://www.poewiki.net)

PoE Palette also knows about a hand-curated list of other smaller tools and websites, e.g. [PoELab](https://www.poelab.com), [Vorici Chromatic Calculator](https://siveran.github.io/calc.html), [Timeless Jewel Finder](https://vilsol.github.io/timeless-jewels/tree) and the [Patch Notes Archive](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-forum/patch-notes).

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/flbraun/poe-palette/releases).
2. Extract the archive and run the `poe-palette.exe` you will find inside.
   When you first start the program, you will probably be warned that it will put your computer at risk. This is because the application does not digitally sign its code. As long as you download the official version from the above page, you can be sure that the program is safe to use!
   Click "More info", then "Run anyway" to proceed.
3. PoE Palette will now start in the background and appear in your system tray.

## Configuration
You can configure the app by right clicking its tray icon (the Mirror of Kalandra icon).

Here you can choose which type of results should appear in your search results and in which league you are playing. The latter is important for referring you to the correct external resources (e.g. trade links).

## Using the palette
The palette can be opened (and hidden) by pressing the shortcut `Ctrl+P`.

Start typing for what you're looking, e.g. `abberath`. PoE Palette will now perform a fuzzy, case-insensitive search for your term against its internal index and present you with a list of results.

From here on you can either refine your search, or navigate through the results with the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys. Hitting `Enter` will open the currently highlighted result and close the palette.

### Performing a prefixed search
You may also perform a **prefixed search**. A prefixed search consists of a special prefix (see below) followed by a colon followed by your search term, e.g. `wiki:abberath`. This will limit search results to - in this case - articles in the community wiki. This is very handy when you already know where you want to go, saving you time when navigating through the result list.

The available search prefixes are `wiki`, `poedb`, `ninja`, `trade`, `tft`, `antiq`, `craft` and `tool`.

Please note that prefixed searches for resources disabled in the configuration will not work!

### Opening the palette for an ingame item
You may also hover over an item in the game and press the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P`. The palette will then open prefilled with the item's name. This allows for quickly opening that item in an external resource, e.g. poe.ninja.

## FAQ
#### Search results don't show a PoE Ninja result for my item!
PoE Ninja does not list _every_ item in the game because they pull their data from GGG's public stash API. So, if no player lists a worthless or exceedingly rare item it does not appear on PoE Ninja, and consequently PoE Palette will not show results for it.
If your item is actually listed on [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja) please [open an issue](https://github.com/flbraun/poe-palette/issues/new/choose).

#### How can I change the palette shortcuts?
You are able to change the shortcuts for both toggling the palette and the ingame item search, but there is no UI for it currently. You can change them manually by editing PoE Palette's config file with a text editor (e.g. Notepad) though.
The config file is located at `%APPDATA%\poe-palette\config.json`. **Please exit PoE Palette before modifying this file.**
Check the [official Electron documentation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/accelerator#available-modifiers) for available key codes and modifiers.

#### It's league start and the tool isn't working properly!
For PoE Palette to work correctly, all connected tools need to make their adaptations for the new league first. Some tools handle this more graceful than others. On top of that there may be changes required to PoE Palette itself. All of that takes time, and the developers likely want to play the new league just as much as you want. As a general guideline, expect everything to be ironed out at the end of the first week.
